# Sappohs_CreativeCommons_PNG
Sappoh's Creative Commons PNG, for everyone.

When you need an PNG for commercial purposes, finding it for free isn't always easy.</BR>
Many times the licenses are not reported, and you can't really tell if the image you are using is truly copyright free.
That's why I decided to release some of the PNG I made, so that others can use them too.</BR>
